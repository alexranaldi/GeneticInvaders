# GeneticInvaders
My take on space Invaders in MATLAB.

Add files to the path, run "GeneticInvaders". Use arrow keys left and right to move, and the spacebar to fire. Each invader is created from a series of "Genes", with some random variation. Any invaders that get passed your ship pass their genes on to the successive generations of invaders! Genes include color (separate for red, green, blue), luminosity, density of the invader, separate X and Y speed, Y jitter, and boldness. Seems to work on MATLAB R2018a, but use OpenGL rendering to prevent flicker. Perhaps try "opengl software" prior to running the code.
